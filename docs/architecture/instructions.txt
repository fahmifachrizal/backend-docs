ARCHITECTURE FOLDER DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES
==========================================

Folder: docs/architecture/

Purpose:
This folder explains the *system-level design* of the backend application.
It answers: "How is this system structured and why?"

This folder must stay framework-agnostic where possible and focus on
decisions, boundaries, and flows rather than code.

--------------------------------------------------

File: overview.md

What to write:
- High-level description of the system (Inventory Management Monolith)
- Core goals of the system (scalability, clarity, comparability)
- Target users (developers, reviewers, decision makers)
- What this system is NOT (not microservices, not event-driven)
- Summary diagram description (textual explanation if no diagram)

Key sections:
- System Purpose
- High-Level Components
- Deployment Model (single service, monolith)
- Technology Stack Summary
- Design Constraints

--------------------------------------------------

File: monolith-design.md

What to write:
- Explanation of why monolith architecture was chosen
- Definition of “modular monolith” in this project
- How services are logically separated (auth, users, inventory, etc.)
- How shared infrastructure is handled (DB, cache, config)
- Rules for module boundaries (what can call what)

Key sections:
- Monolith vs Microservices (brief comparison)
- Module Isolation Rules
- Dependency Direction (controllers → services → repositories)
- Shared vs Owned Resources
- Future Scalability Considerations

--------------------------------------------------

File: authentication-flow.md

What to write:
- End-to-end authentication flow description
- How registration works conceptually
- How login works conceptually
- Token lifecycle (creation, validation, expiration)
- How auth is enforced across services

Key sections:
- Registration Flow
- Login Flow
- Token Strategy (JWT, expiration, refresh if any)
- Authorization Check Flow
- Failure Scenarios

--------------------------------------------------

File: error-handling.md

What to write:
- Global error handling philosophy
- Error categories (validation, auth, business, system)
- Error response format standard
- Logging strategy for errors
- How errors propagate through layers

Key sections:
- Error Classification
- Standard Error Response Schema
- Controller vs Service Errors
- Logging & Observability
- Client-Facing vs Internal Errors

--------------------------------------------------

Writing Rules for This Folder:
- No code snippets unless absolutely necessary
- Use diagrams only if they add clarity (optional)
- Focus on decisions, not implementation
- Keep explanations readable for non-framework experts
- Assume the reader has general backend knowledge
