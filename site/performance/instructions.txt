PERFORMANCE FOLDER DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES
==========================================

Folder: docs/performance/

Purpose:
This folder documents how the system performs, how performance is measured,
and what strategies are used to optimize runtime behavior.
It supports fair comparison across backend frameworks.

Performance here is about:
- Startup time
- Request latency
- Throughput
- Resource usage
- Cache effectiveness

--------------------------------------------------

File: caching-strategy.md

What to write:
- Why caching is used in this system
- Which data is cacheable and why
- Cache scope (in-memory, distributed, per-instance)
- Cache key design principles
- Cache invalidation rules

Key sections:
- Cache Use Cases (read-heavy endpoints)
- Cached Data Types (lists, aggregates, lookups)
- Cache Key Design
- TTL Strategy
- Cache Invalidation Triggers

--------------------------------------------------

File: benchmarks.md

What to write:
- What metrics are measured
- How benchmarks are executed
- Hardware and environment assumptions
- Tools used for benchmarking
- How results should be interpreted

Key sections:
- Benchmark Goals
- Measurement Environment
- Metrics Definition (latency, RPS, startup time)
- Test Scenarios
- Result Interpretation Guidelines

--------------------------------------------------

File: load-testing.md

What to write:
- Load testing philosophy
- Types of load tests performed
- Traffic patterns simulated
- Failure thresholds and expectations
- Observed bottlenecks

Key sections:
- Load Profiles (steady, spike, stress)
- Concurrency Levels
- Endpoint Selection
- Resource Monitoring (CPU, memory)
- Stability and Degradation Behavior

--------------------------------------------------

Writing Rules for This Folder:
- Use numbers, not opinions
- Always state assumptions
- Avoid framework-specific tuning tricks
- Focus on repeatable and comparable tests
- Keep conclusions separate from raw results
