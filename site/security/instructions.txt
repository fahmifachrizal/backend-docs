SECURITY FOLDER DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES
=======================================

Folder: docs/security/

Purpose:
This folder documents how the system protects data, identities, and access.
It explains security decisions at a conceptual and implementation-policy level,
not framework-specific syntax.

Security here focuses on:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Data protection
- Attack surface reduction
- Secure defaults

--------------------------------------------------

File: encryption.md

What to write:
- What data is considered sensitive
- Encryption strategy for data at rest
- Encryption strategy for data in transit
- Key management approach
- Limitations and trade-offs

Key sections:
- Sensitive Data Classification
- Encryption Algorithms Used
- Storage Encryption Strategy
- Transport Security (TLS assumptions)
- Key Rotation and Storage

--------------------------------------------------

File: password-hashing.md

What to write:
- Why password hashing is required
- Hashing algorithm choice and rationale
- Salting strategy
- Password verification flow
- Protection against common attacks

Key sections:
- Hashing vs Encryption
- Algorithm Selection
- Salt and Cost Factor Strategy
- Login Verification Flow
- Brute Force and Timing Attack Mitigation

--------------------------------------------------

File: jwt.md

What to write:
- Purpose of JWT in the system
- Token structure and claims
- Token lifetime and expiration
- Token validation rules
- Token revocation strategy (if any)

Key sections:
- Token Payload Design
- Signing Algorithm
- Expiration and Renewal
- Validation Flow
- Security Considerations

--------------------------------------------------

File: role-permissions.md

What to write:
- Role-based access control model
- Defined roles in the system
- Permission granularity
- How permissions are enforced
- Role evolution strategy

Key sections:
- Role Definitions
- Permission Mapping
- Authorization Enforcement Flow
- Default Access Rules
- Role Extension Strategy

--------------------------------------------------

Writing Rules for This Folder:
- Never include secrets or real keys
- Explain “why” before “how”
- Assume attacker mindset when explaining defenses
- Avoid security-through-obscurity explanations
- Keep it auditable and clear
